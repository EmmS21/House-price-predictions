Predicting the price of houses

The objective of this project is to build a model that helps predict the price of a house in Brooklyn and visualizes the data presented to get a better understanding of: i.) sales per year and the price of houses sold in a given year (visualising the effects of gentrification), ii.) distribution of  house prices in different neighbourhoods.

I tested different models to understand which model would deliver the best results.
